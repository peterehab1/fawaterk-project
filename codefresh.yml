# Installation ---
# 1. In Bitbucket, add $FTP_USERNAME $FTP_PASSWORD and $FTP_HOST as environment variables.
# 2. Commit this file to your repo
# 3. From Bitbucket Cloud > Commits > Commit Number > Run Pipeline > Custom:Init (this will
#    push everything and initial GitFTP)
#
# Usage ---
# - On each commit to master branch, it'll push all files to the $FTP_HOST
# - You also have the option to 'init' (from Bitbucket Cloud) - pushes everything and initialises
# - Finally you can also 'deploy-all' (from Bitbucket Cloud) - if multiple deploys fail, you
#   can deploy everything to "catch up"
